## Completed Work (Phases 0-2c)

### Phase 0: Emergency Fixes ‚úÖ
- ThreadedExecutor async wrapper for test compatibility
- Namespace merge-only policy implementation
- Event loop management fixes
- Message protocol completeness

### Phase 1: AsyncExecutor Foundation ‚úÖ
- Execution mode detection (AST analysis)
- PyCF_ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT constant (0x2000)
- Blocking I/O detection with attribute chains
- DI factory pattern (async_executor_factory)
- Configurable timeouts and cache sizes

### Phase 2: Promise-First Integration ‚úÖ
- Durable functions using ctx.promise pattern
- Complete protocol correlation (Execute/Result/Error, Input/InputResponse)
- Session interceptors for message routing
- Worker stabilization (output ordering, checkpoint/restore)
- Single-loop invariant enforcement

## Immediate Priorities (Phase 3: Native Async)

**Goal**: Complete AsyncExecutor to handle async code natively without ThreadedExecutor delegation.

### Deliverables (3-4 days estimated)

#### 3.1 EventLoopCoordinator
```python
# Target implementation
- ensure_event_loop() - Detect/create loops safely
- queue_for_async() - Queue coroutines when not in async context
- flush_queue() - Execute queued operations
```

#### 3.2 CoroutineManager
```python
# Target implementation
- track_coroutine() with weak references
- track_task() for asyncio.Task lifecycle
- cleanup() with proper stats
```

#### 3.3 ExecutionCancellation
```python
# Target implementation
- cancel_execution() for running code
- check_cancelled() periodic checks
- cancellable_execution() context manager
```

#### 3.4 Native Execution Paths
- Implement `_execute_top_level_await()` using PyCF_ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT
- Complete AST transformation fallback
- Remove ThreadedExecutor delegation for async code

### Success Criteria
- [ ] AsyncExecutor handles all execution modes natively
- [ ] Proper coroutine cleanup and cancellation
