IPYTHON INTEGRATION INVESTIGATION REPORT

Generated: 2025-08-27 00:52:19

OVERALL SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
Total Test Categories: 5
Passed: 1
Failed: 4
Success Rate: 20.0%

CATEGORY ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
BASIC           ✓ PASSED
  Basic IPython functionality (import, shell creation, async, I/O, errors)
NAMESPACE       ✗ FAILED
  Namespace bridging with PyREPL3 NamespaceManager
PROTOCOL        ✗ FAILED
  Protocol message integration for I/O and results
CAPABILITIES    ✗ FAILED
  Capability injection and security policies
PERFORMANCE     ✗ FAILED
  Performance, cancellation, and event system

CRITICAL FINDINGS
----------------------------------------
  ✓ IPython core functionality works well
  ✓ Async execution and top-level await supported
  ✓ I/O streams can be overridden successfully
  ✗ Namespace integration problematic
  ✗ Protocol integration needs work
  ✗ Capability system integration failed
  ✗ Performance/event integration issues

RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
✗ IPython integration NOT RECOMMENDED:
  1. Too many integration issues
  2. Better to keep custom implementation
  3. Consider extracting specific IPython components

ISSUES TO ADDRESS
----------------------------------------
  1. Cancellation: Need custom sys.settrace equivalent
  2. Security: IPython preprocessors insufficient
  3. Concurrency: InteractiveShell singleton problematic
  4. Performance: Overhead needs optimization
  5. Protocol: Full integration needs more work

INTEGRATION EFFORT ESTIMATE
----------------------------------------
  Custom implementation recommended
  IPython integration would take 8-12 weeks
  High risk of incomplete feature parity
