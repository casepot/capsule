# Multi‑Model Review Summary

## Provider Summaries
### claude-code (claude-opus-4.1)
Sample review from Claude Code for testing. The PR looks good overall with no critical issues.

### codex-cli (gpt-4)
Codex review complete. Found one security concern that should be addressed.

### gemini-cli (gemini-1.5-pro)
Gemini analysis complete. Identified performance and security concerns.

## Must‑fix (union)
- [high] (codex-cli) security — Potential command injection vulnerability in subprocess call — src/executor.py:45-50
  - Suggestion: Use shlex.quote() to properly escape shell arguments
  - Evidence: Direct string concatenation in subprocess call
- [high] (gemini-cli) security — Command injection risk in subprocess execution — src/executor.py:45-50
  - Suggestion: Sanitize inputs before passing to subprocess
  - Evidence: Unsanitized user input in subprocess call

## Assumptions with uncertainty
- (codex-cli) Input validation is properly implemented
  - Falsify by: Test with malformed input data
- (gemini-cli) The session pool size is appropriate for production load
  - Falsify by: Load test with 100+ concurrent sessions

## Gate: **FAIL**
