  },
  "summary": "This is a transformative architectural refactoring that replaces hardcoded scripts with a robust, configuration-driven system. It significantly improves security, maintainability, and extensibility. The primary finding is a critical security risk due to the use of `eval` in the GitHub workflow, which must be fixed. A minor correctness issue in report aggregation is also noted. Overall, an excellent and necessary upgrade pending the security fix.",

      "message": "The workflow uses `eval \"$TEST_CMD\"` to run the test command. While `TEST_CMD` is sourced from repository variables (which is more secure than from PR code), using `eval` is inherently dangerous and creates a shell injection vulnerability. If the `TEST_CMD` variable contains malicious content or special characters, it could lead to arbitrary code execution on the self-hosted runner.",
      "suggestion": "Avoid `eval`. Instead, write the test command to a temporary script file and execute that script, or pass the command and its arguments directly to a shell that can execute it without `eval`. For example: `bash -c \"$TEST_CMD\"` is slightly better, but the safest is to have a dedicated script that takes the command as an argument.",
