  "summary": "Solid shift to structured, config-driven provider execution with OAuth guardrails. Main concerns: eval use for TEST_CMD, env not sanitized inside executor, outdated tests mismatched to new design, repeated npm install and no lockfile. No critical breakages observed; recommend tightening security and test alignment before merge.",
