# Planning Prompt Engineering Methodology

## Core Checklist: The PARIS Framework

**P**roblem Archaeology → **A**rchitecture Recognition → **R**isk Illumination → **I**mplementation Scaffolding → **S**uccess Validation

1. **Problem Archaeology**: Excavate failure patterns and historical attempts
2. **Architecture Recognition**: Map existing infrastructure and invariants  
3. **Risk Illumination**: Identify failure modes before solution design
4. **Implementation Scaffolding**: Structure solution space with clear boundaries
5. **Success Validation**: Define measurable outcomes and test strategies

## Why This Works

Planning prompts fail when they lack historical context or ignore existing constraints. This methodology ensures the planner understands:
- What has been tried and why it failed
- What infrastructure already exists
- What constraints are non-negotiable
- What success looks like concretely

## Document Structure

Each phase has its own focused document:
- `01-problem-archaeology.md` - Mining historical failures
- `02-architecture-recognition.md` - Mapping the existing landscape
- `03-risk-illumination.md` - Anticipating failure modes
- `04-implementation-scaffolding.md` - Structuring the solution space
- `05-success-validation.md` - Defining victory conditions
- `06-prompt-calibration.md` - Tuning autonomy and precision
- `07-integration-guide.md` - Assembling the complete prompt

## Key Principles

### 1. Historical Awareness
Never plan in a vacuum. Understanding past failures prevents repetition and reveals hidden constraints.

### 2. Infrastructure Respect
Leverage what exists. The best solutions connect existing pieces rather than creating new systems.

### 3. Early Risk Detection
Identify failure modes during planning, not implementation. Each risk needs a specific mitigation.

### 4. Concrete Specificity
Vague plans produce vague implementations. Every requirement needs measurable success criteria.

### 5. Calibrated Autonomy
Adjust the planner's freedom based on problem complexity and solution space size.

## Quick Start

For any new planning task:
1. Run through the PARIS checklist
2. Fill out each phase template
3. Calibrate prompt eagerness based on solution space
4. Validate against success criteria
5. Iterate based on planner feedback

## Reproducibility

This methodology is domain-agnostic. Whether planning:
- Software architecture changes
- Migration strategies  
- Performance optimizations
- Security implementations
- API designs

The same phases apply. The content changes; the structure remains.
