# Workspace Branch

This branch preserves all development notes, planning documents, large artifacts (e.g., PDFs), and misc files that were removed from `master` to keep it clean and production-focused.

- Snapshot tag prior to cleanup: search tags starting with `pre-cleanup-snapshot/`.
- If a document you expect on `master` is missing, check here first.
- Issue body sources are under `issues/` for reference.

Contributions to this branch are generally docs-only; code changes should target `master` via feature branches and PRs.
