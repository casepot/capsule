# Phase 0 Emergency Fixes - Complete Change Summary

## PR #10: Foundation Phase 0 Emergency Fixes
**Branch**: `fix/foundation-phase0-emergency-fixes`  
**Test Pass Rate**: 98.7% (78/79 unit tests)  
**Status**: Ready to merge to master

## Overview
Phase 0 implements critical fixes to unblock testing and establish a solid foundation for the transition from ThreadedExecutor to AsyncExecutor architecture. All changes maintain backward compatibility while preparing for future async implementation.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Files Created

#### `src/subprocess/async_executor.py` (398 lines)
- Skeleton AsyncExecutor implementation for transition period
- ExecutionMode enum and detection logic (TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT, ASYNC_DEF, etc.)
- AST-based code analysis with LRU cache (100 entry limit)
- Event loop management without ownership (no dangerous __del__)
- Explicit lifecycle management (close() method and context manager)
- ThreadedExecutor delegation for all execution modes
- PyCF_ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT constant (0x1000000) for Python 3.11+

#### `src/subprocess/constants.py` (24 lines)
- Centralized ENGINE_INTERNALS definition
- Single source of truth for protected namespace keys
- Prevents drift between namespace.py and worker.py

#### `tests/unit/test_async_executor.py` (536 lines, 23 tests)
- Comprehensive test coverage for AsyncExecutor
- Tests for ExecutionMode detection
- Event loop management tests
- Lifecycle management tests (close(), context manager)
- Integration tests with NamespaceManager

#### `tests/unit/test_namespace_merge.py` (325 lines, 12 tests)
- Tests for namespace merge-only policy
- ENGINE_INTERNALS protection verification
- Thread safety tests
- Integration tests with SubprocessWorker

### 2. Modified Files

#### `src/subprocess/executor.py`
- Added async wrapper `execute_code_async()` for compatibility
- Comprehensive docstring explaining dual sync/async API
- Fixed deprecated `asyncio.get_event_loop()` â†’ `get_running_loop()`
- Added structlog import and logger for timeout debugging
- Timeout exception logging in async wrapper

#### `src/subprocess/namespace.py`
- Imports ENGINE_INTERNALS from constants.py
- Extracted smart merge logic to `_should_update_smart()` method
- Enhanced merge strategies (overwrite, preserve, smart)
- Result history tracking (_, __, ___)
- Clear() method preserves engine internals

#### `src/subprocess/worker.py`
- Imports ENGINE_INTERNALS from constants.py
- Removed duplicate ENGINE_INTERNALS definition
- Namespace initialization uses merge-only policy

#### `tests/unit/test_executor.py`
- Fixed flaky `test_output_capture` with event-based synchronization
- Added skip marker to `test_cancellation` with detailed explanation
- Fixed all uses of deprecated `get_event_loop()`

#### `tests/unit/test_messages.py`
- Fixed missing `execution_time` in ResultMessage tests
- Fixed missing fields in HeartbeatMessage tests

### 3. Documentation Updates

#### `FOUNDATION_FIX_PLAN.md`
- Updated status to Day 4 complete with PR review fixes
- Documented all critical, medium, and low priority fixes
- Updated test pass rate to 78/79
- Added implementation details for all completed work

#### PDF Documentation
- Renamed for clarity: `PyCF_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT_spec.pdf`
- Documents PyCF_ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT usage and design

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### Event Loop Management (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: AsyncExecutor closed event loops in __del__, risking closure of running/global loops  
**Solution**: 
- Removed __del__ method entirely
- Added explicit close() method for cleanup
- Added async context manager support
- Never modify or own external event loops

### Exception Handling (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Timeout exceptions silently swallowed, could mask issues  
**Solution**:
- Added debug logging for timeout exceptions
- Documented why timeouts are acceptable in tests
- Proper exception context in logs

### Namespace Management (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Risk of replacing namespace instead of merging  
**Solution**:
- Enforced merge-only policy
- ENGINE_INTERNALS always preserved
- Smart merge strategies implemented

## Test Infrastructure Improvements

### Flaky Test Fixes
- Replaced `asyncio.sleep()` with event-based synchronization
- Tests now wait for actual events instead of fixed timeouts
- More reliable test execution

### Brittle Test Fixes
- Removed reliance on __del__ timing
- Tests use explicit lifecycle methods
- Context manager tests added

## Code Quality Improvements

- Removed unused imports (sys, Optional)
- Added LRU cache limit to prevent memory growth
- Improved documentation and docstrings
- Centralized constants to prevent drift
- Extracted complex logic to dedicated methods

## Compatibility Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- ThreadedExecutor continues to work as before
- AsyncExecutor delegates to ThreadedExecutor (transition period)
- Tests updated to use new patterns without breaking existing code

## Known Issues

- Cancellation test temporarily skipped due to pre-existing KeyboardInterrupt propagation issue
- This issue is unrelated to Phase 0 changes and requires separate signal handling fix

## Next Steps (Phase 1)

With Phase 0 complete and stable, the codebase is ready for:
1. Implementing actual async execution in AsyncExecutor
2. PyCF_ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT compile flag usage
3. Promise abstraction layer (pre-Resonate)
4. Capability base classes
5. Full transition from ThreadedExecutor to AsyncExecutor
