# PyREPL3 Deadlock Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
The PyREPL3 system has multiple critical issues preventing basic functionality. While worker processes can start and send ready messages, code execution hangs indefinitely due to communication failures between components.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Worker stdin/stdout initialization
- **Problem**: Worker created StreamReader/Writer with None parameters
- **Solution**: Use sys.stdin.buffer and sys.stdout.buffer with proper pipe connection
- **Status**: Worker now starts successfully

### 2. ✅ FIXED: AsyncIterator await bug
- **Problem**: Session._warmup() tried to await an AsyncIterator
- **Solution**: Changed to `async for _ in self.execute(message): pass`
- **Status**: Warmup no longer crashes

### 3. ✅ FIXED: Protocol drain helper
- **Problem**: Basic Protocol() doesn't have _drain_helper method
- **Solution**: Use StreamReaderProtocol for writer
- **Status**: Messages can be sent without crash

### 4. ✅ FIXED: Logger stdout interference
- **Problem**: Structlog wrote to stdout, corrupting binary message stream
- **Solution**: Configure logger to use stderr
- **Status**: Message stream no longer corrupted

### 5. ✅ FIXED: Message routing
- **Problem**: _route_message created wrong handler keys
- **Solution**: Route by execution_id to correct queue
- **Status**: Messages routed to execution queues

## Remaining Critical Issues

### 1. ❌ Execute messages not delivered to worker
- **Symptom**: Worker receive loop blocks, never gets execute messages
- **Evidence**: Heartbeat received but execute not processed
- **Hypothesis**: MessageTransport buffering or framing issue

### 2. ❌ Session manager hangs on execute
- **Symptom**: Timeout after 5 seconds waiting for response
- **Evidence**: No output/result messages received
- **Hypothesis**: Bidirectional communication broken in PipeTransport

### 3. ❌ Type checking errors persist
- **Count**: 14 errors in basedpyright
- **Impact**: Type confusion at runtime
- **Root cause**: Message type hierarchy uses incompatible narrowing

## Test Results

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Worker startup | ✅ PASS | Starts in ~0.08s |
| Direct subprocess | ✅ PASS | Can send/receive msgpack frames |
| Bidirectional raw | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Receives heartbeat only |
| Session execute | ❌ FAIL | Timeout, no responses |
| main.py demos | ❌ FAIL | Hangs indefinitely |

## Root Cause Analysis

The communication pipeline has multiple failure points:

```
Session.execute() 
    → PipeTransport.send_message() 
        → MessageTransport.send_message()
            → FrameWriter.write_frame()
                → process.stdin.write()
                    ❌ Worker never receives
```

The worker's receive loop blocks on:
```python
message = await self._transport.receive_message()  # Blocks here
```

This suggests the framing layer is not properly delivering messages bidirectionally.

## Next Steps

1. **Debug framing layer**: Add extensive logging to track frame boundaries
2. **Test raw pipe communication**: Bypass MessageTransport to isolate issue
3. **Implement timeouts**: Add asyncio.wait_for to all blocking operations
4. **Fix type hierarchy**: Use discriminated unions properly
5. **Add integration tests**: Test full flow with timeouts

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always use binary streams**: sys.stdin.buffer, not sys.stdin
2. **Logger configuration matters**: stdout corruption breaks binary protocols
3. **Type checking catches real bugs**: AsyncIterator await would crash at runtime
4. **Defensive timeouts essential**: Infinite hangs make debugging impossible
5. **Layer isolation critical**: Test each layer independently
