    "summary": "Robust, leak-free input() bridging achieved",
    "details": "Successfully transformed fragile input() implementation into production-ready system. Total improvements: 1) Prompt flushing ensures prompts appear in output stream matching Python REPL behavior. 2) Configurable timeouts allow adaptation to different environments. 3) Guaranteed cleanup prevents memory leaks. 4) Shutdown handling prevents hanging threads. 5) Proper exceptions (EOFError, TimeoutError) follow Python conventions. System now handles all edge cases: concurrent inputs, shutdown during wait, timeout scenarios, special characters in prompts.",

    "falsification_steps": null,
    "outcome": "Production-ready input() implementation with comprehensive test coverage",
    "notes": "Key architectural principle maintained: synchronous user code in threads uses blocking input(), while infrastructure remains async. The finally block pattern ensures cleanup in all paths - success, timeout, error, or shutdown."
